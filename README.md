# Perrin-frerres-monthly-champagne-ARIMA
This is a simple time series forecasting challenge of the sales data of champagnes of a company named 'Perrin Freres'. The 
dataset is avalaible here

I have used an ARIMA model from statsmodels api to predict the forecast, and also extrapolated the dates to predict forecasts 
for dates that are not present in the dataset. Thanks.
